# The can problem
  
 ![The cans](cans.png)
  
At a fairground stall there are 3 piles of cans.  
You get 3 throws.  
You can only knock off the top can of a pile.  
Each throw scores according to the number of the can.  
The 2nd throw counts double, the 3rd triple.  
How do you score exactly 50?
